## Welcome!

This repo contains the samples that demonstrate the API usage patterns for Microsoft Xbox Live Service.
These code samples target the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Xbox One XDK.
To get access to the Xbox Live service, you can join the Xbox Live Creators Program at https://aka.ms/xblcp, or apply to the ID@Xbox program at http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id

## How to clone repo

This repo contains submodules.  There are two ways to make sure you get submodules.

When initially cloning, make sure you use the "--recursive" option. IE:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-samples.git

If you already cloned the repo, you can initialize submodules with:

    git submodule sync
    git submodule update --init --recursive

**Note that using GitHub's feature to "Download Zip" instead of cloning does not contain the submodules and will not properly build.  Please clone recursively instead.**

## How to run samples

You need to change the target devices sandbox to XDKS.1, and sign in with any Xbox Live enabled account.

For details on how to change sandbox for developers in the Xbox Live Creators Program, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-live/get-started-with-creators/xbox-live-sandboxes-creators

For details on how to change sandbox for developers in ID@Xbox Program, see:
